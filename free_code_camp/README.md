# learning of RUST Monster....

### What is macro ??
- a way of defining reusable chunks of code
- ex. like println!, assert_eq! etc.    

### assert_eq!() & assert!

    - for check x and y is equal or not
    - assert! is a cousin of assert_eq!

- A reference is created by & and dereferenced by \*.
- You cannot print out an array in the usual way with {} but you can do a debug print with {:?}.

- in rust language when we not assign any type do i32 and f64 id assigning by default.
