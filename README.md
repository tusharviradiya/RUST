# RUST

- **rustc** : Rustc is the Rust compiler, responsible for translating Rust source code into executable binaries. It performs various tasks including parsing Rust code, checking it for errors, optimizing performance, and generating machine code. Rustc is typically invoked from the command line with rustc [filename.rs]. It's also possible to use rustc programmatically through its library interface.

- **Cargo** : Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, building projects, and publishing libraries. Cargo also provides features for testing, documentation generation, and more. With Cargo, developers can easily create, share, and manage Rust projects. Common Cargo commands include cargo new to create a new Rust project, cargo build to compile a project, cargo run to compile and execute a project, cargo test to run tests, and cargo publish to publish a crate to crates.io, Rust's official package registry.

# Guessing Game :

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {guess}");

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Variables and Mutability

- by default, variables are immutable
- cannot assign twice to immutable variable

```rust
//for assign twice we make variable mutable.
let mut x = 5;
x = 10;
```

### const

- you arenâ€™t allowed to use mut with constants.
- type of the value must be annotated.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### Shadowing

- Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second
- second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable
- We can shadow a variable by using the same variableâ€™s name and repeating the use of the let keyword as follows
- we not need to make variable mutable when we use let type twice for same variable name.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;//for reassign x we need to use let when we not write let so this gives us error : cannot assign twice to immutable variable.

    { //we make scope using {}
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

- if we try to use mut for this, as shown here, weâ€™ll get a compile-time error

```rust
    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();
```

- The error says weâ€™re not allowed to mutate a variableâ€™s type

# Data types

- converted a String to a numeric type using parse

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");

```

- if we not give u32 : error[E0284]: type annotations needed

## Scalar Types :

1. integer
1. float
1. boolean
1. character

## Integer Types

- integer types default to i32

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

| Number literals | Example        |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Decimal         | 98_222         |
| Hex             | 0xff           |
| Octal           | 0o77           |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000    |
| Byte            | (u8 only) b'A' |

## Floating-Point Types

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

## Numeric Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

## The Boolean Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

## The Character Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

## The Array Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

## The String Type

- declaration of string

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

- we need to make mutable string in rust

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

# Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

## Statements and Expressions

- **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.

# Control flow

### if Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

### Loops

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

### while

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

### for

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

# Ownership

- Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.

1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
1. There can only be one owner at a time.
1. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

- in rust we have one concept which teach us when we move any variable in other variable so first variable is not more usable.
- if we need to make shellow copy we need to .clone()

```rust
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

### Stake

- The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order

### Heap

- when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer

### Ownership and Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

### return value and scope

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

### References and Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### The Slice Type

- Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference,

```rust
    //slice of string
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
```

# tuple

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

# Structure

- A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group

```rust
// structure of structure
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```
